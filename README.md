# Infrastructure Sandbox

Hands-on experiments with Linux, shell scripting, containerization, and infrastructure-as-code tools.

This repository serves as a personal lab for exploring core infrastructure concepts and building reusable patterns for future platform and SRE projects.

---

## Current Scope

- **Linux & Shell Scripting** – foundational commands, automation scripts, troubleshooting techniques
- **Containerization (Planned)** – Docker images, multi-container setups, basic orchestration
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (Planned)** – Terraform modules for cloud resource provisioning
- **Kubernetes & Observability (Planned)** – Helm charts, Prometheus, Grafana dashboards

---

## Repository Layout

- `linux/` – Scripts, notes, and exercises related to Linux fundamentals
- (More folders will be added as new technologies are explored)

---

## Goals

- Build practical automation workflows and scripts
- Strengthen debugging and troubleshooting across infrastructure layers
- Lay groundwork for future platform engineering and SRE projects

---

## Usage
